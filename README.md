# Xenith Challenge
The goal is to create a working To Do list according to the specs.

### To View ToDo App:
https://anthonymarc23.github.io/xenith_challenge/

### To run locally:
Clone the repository, and from the /src directory, open a terminal and run "npm install", and then run "npm start." This should open up localhost:3000 in your default browser.

## Things I learned
A lot of the things that I struggled with but learned a lot from was setting up environments and deploying projects. A lot of this was handled by a senior-level software engineer where I worked, but I now have the knowledge and confidence to be able to create and deploy code as needed.

## Improvements/Functionality To Add
Given more time, a few things I would've wanted to do to further enhance this project would be
- Utilize the jest tools that came packaged with React
- Include further animations and transitions for removing an item from the list and adding an item to the list
- Add the swipe to delete and drag-and-drop re-ordering of the list
- utilize local storage to maintain state beyond the current session and refresh
-
